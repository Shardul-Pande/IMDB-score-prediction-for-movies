Welcome to the IMDB Score Prediction for Movies repository! This project is focused on developing a predictive model for estimating the IMDb scores of movies. The repository contains the code, data, and documentation related to this project.

Overview
Predicting the IMDb scores of movies is a challenging yet intriguing task. This repository hosts the source code and resources for building a predictive model that aims to estimate IMDb scores based on various features and attributes of movies. By experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and techniques, this project seeks to achieve accurate score predictions.

Dataset
The foundation of this project is a carefully curated dataset sourced from IMDb and other relevant movie databases. This dataset includes a wide range of features such as movie genre, cast, crew, budget, runtime, and more. The data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis are presented in the Jupyter notebook link to notebook.

Methodology
The project employs a combination of feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms to create an effective predictive model. Several regression techniques, including but not limited to linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, are implemented and compared. The code for model training and evaluation can be found in the models directory.
